#Pinterest Data Analysis: Seasonal and Personal Interest Trends

## Project Description
This project explores my Pinterest usage data to uncover patterns in pinning behavior based on seasonal trends and changes in personal interests. Using techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization..., to identify how my engagement evolves over time and across different categories.

This analysis will provide insights into:
- How seasonal changes and activities influence my Pinterest activity.
- The evolution of my interests over time.
- Connections between pinning habits and external factors like certain events or personal goals.

The reason I chose this project is, to better understand how my offline interests and seasonal habits reflect on my online behavior or vice versa. Analyzing my Pinterest data offers a unique opportunity to gain self-insights and apply data science techniques to my personal data, and interpret the connections with my real-world life.

The data was exported from my Pinterest account using their official data export tool. The dataset includes information about:
- User profile information and user statistics
- Inferences made based on user activity
- Saved pins with timestamps.
- Boards and their associated pins.
  
The raw data will not be shared publicly, but the analysis scripts will be available.
